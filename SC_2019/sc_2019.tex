% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the article.
\begin{abstract}
Relational algebra forms a basis of primitive operations useful for applications in graphs, networks, program analysis, deductive databases, and logic. Despite its expressive power, relational algebra has not received the same attention in high-performance computing research as linear algebra, X, Y, or Z.

In this paper we present a set of efficient algorithms that tackle the problem of distributed, parallel relational algebra and use experiments from applications in graphs, program analysis, and datalog to evaluate our approach.
